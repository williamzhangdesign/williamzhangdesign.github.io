                        unprofessional
                        <br> 2. CTA horizontal alignment discreptancies across all 3 credit cards, which hinders the

                        <br><br>After mocking up properly aligned elements,
                        I socialized the CTA button text-alignment issue to the
                        enterprise design team to put on their backlog to fix across the entire enterprise. In the

                    <p id="left" class="portfolio_description">As for the redesign, I created numerous variants in
                        medium to
                        high fidelity using Figma,
                        working with product to select a solution that reduces the number of interactions
                        and visible card categories, also leveraging our design system in order to save engineering
                        bandwidth. <br><br>This "ghost-button" tabbed design beat other similar options because of its
                        ability
                        to
                        support mobile interactions and reduce additional scrolling. It was then chosen as the final
                        design put in the market for
                        A/B testing.

                        interested in exploring different credit card categories and products. However, this does not

                        2. credit card description text wasn't always useful, and didn't consistently inform a card's
                        main use (Inconsistent copy)<br>
                        3. certain credit cards not eligible for pre-approval<!-- that were not eligible for pre-approval (a

                        We intended to use different UX treatments to improve

                        With a divergent mindset, these variants served as a good starting point. I then worked
                        with product to converge, modify, and choose variants that given our tech resources, wouldn't
                        overwhelm our awesome engineers, and

                        1. swapping QuicksilverOne for the more popular QuickersilverOne credit card (Marketing

                        2. underlining the Product text-link to a specific product page to signify the ability to learn
                        more (Proper signifiers)<br>
                        3. introducing a "View Card Details" CTA button that took the customer to a specific product
