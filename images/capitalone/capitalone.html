                        knowledge and information. If we could equip them with this information that they
                        seek, and empower them to take action, we could greatly increase the chance of winning for the
                        business.

                            potential customers can make a decision, they need to know:

                        previous design choices that could cause confusion for potential customers. We realized: <br>

                        <br>1. links to the product didn't properly signify the ability to go to a product's information
                        page, preventing customers from exploring and learning more specific details<br>
                        2. credit card description text wasn't always useful
                        <br>3. certain credit cards that were not eligible for pre-approval (a
                        soft hit to
                        credit to view eligible card products) only had an "Apply Now" CTA, and lacked a clear CTA
                        entrypoint to help the customer get more information about a specific product

                        implemented changes that corrected consistency for CTAs, flipping colors for "See if I'm
                        pre-approved" and
                        "Apply Now" to correctly fit customer mental models.<br><br>
                        We intended to test different treatments to improve
                        the way we educate and guide customers. I made changes to
                        information architecture, accessibility, content strategy, and standardized CTAs with different
                        entry-points, creating multiple variants.<br><br>
                        With a divergent mindset, these variants served as a starting point. I then worked
                        with product to converge, modify, and choose variants that given our tech resources, wouldn't
                        overwhelm our awesome engineers, and
                        would feasibly receive
                        buy-in from business leadership.
                        Screenshots of the original variants I designed cannot be shown due to NDA, since the exact
                        designs
                        weren't implemented in market testing.

                        we learned that one variant, with multiple interventions that included:<br><br>
                        1. swapping QuicksilverOne for the more popular QuickersilverOne credit card (Marketing
                        changes)<br>
                        2. underlining the Product text-link to a specific product page to signify the ability to learn
                        more (Proper signifiers)<br>
                        3. introducing a "View Card Details" CTA button that took the customer to a specific product
                        page if that product didn't have pre-approval (Clear entrypoints to gain crucial product
                        information)<br><br>
                        <strong>beat out 7 other variants, leading to a 4.7% lift in new accounts booked. Assuming the design was implemented and metrics were annualized, revenue would increase by a whopping $13.7m!
